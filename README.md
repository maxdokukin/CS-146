# CS 146 Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementations of advanced tree structures, priority queues, heaps, directed and undirected graphs. Advanced searching and sorting techniques (radix sort, heapsort, mergesort, and quicksort). Design and analysis of data structures and algorithms. Divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithm design techniques.

23_Trees:
Implements a custom tree data structure, featuring insertion and search functionalities with efficient sizing methods. It utilizes nodes with variable key counts and handles subtree sizes dynamically, ensuring balanced tree growth and optimized search times. Can be sized to B-tree data structure.

Heap:
Implements a MaxHeap data structure specifically designed to manage Student objects, prioritizing students based on a custom comparison criterion. It offers efficient heap operations including insertion, maximum extraction, and dynamic grade updates, maintaining heap integrity at all times.

Task_Schedule:
Features a job scheduling system that manages dependencies and completion times, utilizing dynamic programming with memoization for efficient computation of job start times. It employs topological sorting and path calculation algorithms to optimize the total finish time calculation, leveraging stored results to handle overlapping subproblems.

Vertex_Cover: Program for for finding the minimum vertex cover in an undirected graph, employing an algorithm that iteratively identifies and marks crucial vertices. It features a custom UndirectedGraph class with methods to manipulate graph size, check cover existence, and remove vertices, enabling computation of vertex covers.
